      <h3>Design & Development</h3>
      <p>Design and creation have always been part of my life. Programming has become increasingly my preferred way of bringing these skills to light.</p>
      <h3>Drawing</h3>
      <p>I started drawing when I was a kid and never stopped. Since then I have studied drawing, painting and sculpting. Today I apply this knowledge designing websites and applications.</p>
