Be it the people I work with, live with or clients, I always seek to build positive relationships and collaborative\r\n        environments where everyone can interact and express themselves. Personally speaking, this attitude has always enabled me\r\n        an agile and adaptable development along with those who work with me, in addition to the development of freer and less\r\n        restrictive environments where people grow together.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Design & Development</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p>I started drawing when I was a kid and never stopped. Since then I have formally studied drawing, painting and sculpting.</p>\r\n        <p>I have always been passionate about art and open to aesthetic, cultural and intellectual experiences, and applying that\r\n        passion to programming is my goal for the future. So I intend to study Web Design and UI / UX Design, and include all this\r\n        knowledge in my work as a developer.</p>\r\n        <p>My main goal is to apply an evergrowing knowledge in the production of relevant software, which has the potential to\r\n        contribute to the well-being and practicality of people's lives.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;"],"sourceRoot":""}
